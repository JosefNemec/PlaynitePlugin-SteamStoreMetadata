Info
---------

This is a [Playnite](https://playnite.link/) plugin that gives you an option to download game information from Steam store even for games that are not imported from Steam.

When downloading metadata while editing game, it will give you an option to specifically choose what store page to use as metadata source. When downloading metdata in bulk, it will try and match games automatically (it's not and can't be 100% accurate).
